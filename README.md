This is a simple quiz game where you have to choose the artist that sings a specific line of lyrics. It uses the `MediaPlayer` framework to read your local music library, and also the Apple Music and Musixmatch API.

## How to run this project

Insert your Apple Music token and Musixmatch API key in the `Token` struct. If you don't have one, follow the instructions bellow:
